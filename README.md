# SampleProject
This is a sample project for the purpose of demonstration. 
I have worked on lots of enterprise projects for different companies which I cannot share the codes on the internet. 
So, I decided to make a sample project with the following features: 

• .Net Core 2.2

• C#.NET 

• Onion Architecture

• WebAPI 

• Microservices architecture

• Ocelot 

• JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication 

• Claims-based authorization

• SQL Server 

• Entity Framework (Code-First)

• TDD 

• Unit Testing

• Integration Testing

I focus on the layers, tools and technologies. 
The domain is totally simple and contains only simple tables. 
I am working on it and complete this demo whenever I find a free time. 
After completion, I am going to use this structure for implementation of the new version of one of my personal projects (www.khodshenas.ir) and this time in English.
