# SampleProject
This is a sample project for the purpose of demonstration. 
I have worked on lots of enterprise projects for different companies which I cannot share the codes on the internet. 
So, I decided to make a sample project with the following features: 
• .NetCore 2.2
• C#.NET 
• Onion Architecture
• WebAPI 
• SQL Server 
• Entity Framework (Code First)
• TDD 
• Unit Testing

I focus on the layers, tools and technologies. 
The domain is totally simple and contains only simple tables. 
I am working on it and complete this demo whenever I have a free time. 
After completion, I am going to use this structure for implementation of the new version of one of my personal projects (www.khodshenas.ir) and this time in English.
